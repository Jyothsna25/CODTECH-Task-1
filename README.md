### Objective:
The e-commerce project encompasses a React frontend for dynamic user interactions and a Node.js backend with JSON-based server storage, ensuring responsive design and robust data management for seamless online shopping experiences.

### Technologies used: 
**React:** 
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state using a virtual DOM for optimal rendering performance.
**Node.js:** 
A server-side JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript code on the server, facilitating the creation of scalable and high-performance backend applications.
**JSON Server:** A simple and lightweight server built on Node.js that allows you to create a REST API with CRUD operations based on a JSON file. It's commonly used for prototyping and mocking APIs in development environments.
**Babel:**
A JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features (ES6, ES7, ES8, etc.) and compile them into browser-compatible JavaScript. It's often used in React projects to transpile JSX syntax and ES6+ features.
**Axios:**
A promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that is commonly used in frontend applications, including React, to make asynchronous HTTP requests to REST APIs. It simplifies handling responses and error handling.
