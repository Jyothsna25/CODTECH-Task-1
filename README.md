### Objective:
The e-commerce project encompasses a React frontend for dynamic user interactions and a Node.js backend with JSON-based server storage, ensuring responsive design and robust data management for seamless online shopping experiences.

### Technologies used:  </br>
**React:** 
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state using a virtual DOM for optimal rendering performance. </br>
**Node.js:** 
A server-side JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript code on the server, facilitating the creation of scalable and high-performance backend applications. </br>
**JSON Server:** A simple and lightweight server built on Node.js that allows you to create a REST API with CRUD operations based on a JSON file. It's commonly used for prototyping and mocking APIs in development environments. </br>
**Babel:**
A JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features (ES6, ES7, ES8, etc.) and compile them into browser-compatible JavaScript. It's often used in React projects to transpile JSX syntax and ES6+ features. </br>
**Axios:**
A promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that is commonly used in frontend applications, including React, to make asynchronous HTTP requests to REST APIs. It simplifies handling responses and error handling.

### Work flow:

### Frontend Development:
**UI/UX Design:** Designers create wireframes and mockups of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). </br>
**React Components:** Developers build reusable UI components using React, incorporating design elements and ensuring responsiveness. </br>
**State Management:** Utilizing Redux or React's built-in state management, developers manage the application's state to maintain consistency across components. </br>
**API Integration:** Frontend developers integrate with backend APIs (built with Node.js and Express) to fetch data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Backend Development:
**API Design:** Define RESTful endpoints for handling various operations like user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, etc. </br>
**Business Logic:** Implement business rules and logic to manage user sessions, product inventory, order processing, payment integration (via services like Stripe or PayPal), and security measures. </br>
**Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT) to verify user identities and authorize access to protected routes and resources.

The achievements of the project is have real experience of using e-commerce site.we named it as one click shopping beacause in a click of the order has been placed. The user can watch upto 5 latest products in the website in the home page only.
